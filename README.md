I want to feed my hunger about technology and its surroundings. So far I have been scavenging the internet for nourishment and I am feeding my mind at teamtreehouse.com already for a month. I am still an infant on this vast and evolving environment and still feeding on milk but somehow curuiosity and interest taunts me to grow fast and I am choking on information that my system doesn't know how to digest them. O well that's my mistake on steering away from the basics. Hahaha!
